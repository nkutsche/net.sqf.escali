                  <h4>Responsibility for content</h4>
                  <p>The content of this web page has been created with the utmost care. However, we can provide no guarantee for the accuracy,
                     completeness and actuality of the content. As service providers we are, according to § 7 para.1 TMG, responsible for our own
                     content on these pages complying with relevant laws. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are as service providers not
                     obliged to supervise or under certain circumstances to search information saved or transmitted by external parties which indicates
                     an illegal act. The obligations to remove or bar the use of information according to general law remain unaffected by this.
                     Responsibility concerning this is, however, only possible after the point at which a concrete infringement has been recognised.
                     Once an infringement has been recognised, we will remove the particular content immediately.

                  <p>Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence upon the content of these sites. Therefore
                     we cannot provide any guarantee for this foreign content. In each instance, the particular provider or manager of the websites
                     is responsible for the content of the linked sites. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for any possible
                     statutory violations. No illegal content was recognisable at the time of the linking. However, a permanent watch over the
                     linked sites is not reasonable without concrete criteria for an infringement. Once an infringement has been recognised, we
                     will removed the particuar links immediately.
